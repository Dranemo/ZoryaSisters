# Zorya Sisters  
Zorya Sisters is a 2D platformer/puzzle developed by SFML. Play as the Zorya sisters, Russian dolls desperate to get out of their owner's house. Using their different powers, overcome the obstacles and puzzles that stand in your way!  
This game is a school project of ours, we developed it in three weeks. The plan was to create several worlds, in the style of the Mario games: each room in the house represented a world with several levels inside. But due to a lack of time, we decided to create a single level showing the different mechanics.

We created this game under our fictitious studio: **Darwin Studios**.
